      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        <em>Hello, I'm Sammy Alia</em>. I am a passionate and driven individual
        with a deep love for technology and creativity. My journey in the world
        of coding and development began at a young age, and I've been exploring
        the vast landscape of programming ever since. I believe in the power of
        innovation to make a positive impact on the world.

          >This is my first 1 <sup>st</sup> website. Some sports I love playing are basketball, football, and
          <abbr title="Mixed Martial Arts">MMA</abbr>. My favorite season is
          fall because the vibes often give me a nostalgic feeling. I tend to
          find beauty in simplicity. I enjoy mangoes and watermelons as well as
          frosted flakes cereal for breakfast.</em
